# Windows Recommended Tools and Tips

These are tools and tips that aren't required, but may help you to be faster and more productive.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You should learn the keyboard shortcuts for tasks that you do frequently (e.g. switching between applications or tabs, opening files, etc.).

As you use the shortcuts, you'll find that many of them are shared between
applications. For instance, `Control + t` is the shortcut to open a new tab on
either Chrome or in VSCode.

Microsoft Support has a full guide on [Keyboard Shortcuts in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec) to browse.

Here are some key shortcuts to learn:

- Windows key opens the launcher. Type the name of an application and press Enter to open it.
- Alt+Tab  switches between applications
- Control+C copies the selected text, Control+V pastes it

## Colors, Fonts, and Customization

Cmder and VSCode support lots of customization. You can set your font, colors,
shortcuts, and tons more preferences.

Here's the documentation links:

- [Cmder Customization](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Customization)
- [VSCode User Interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)

The VSCode guides have more tips, tricks, and configuration options, if you want
to skim it to see what else is possible.

You can also search for customization guides on Google; lots of developers share
their themes and configurations for others to mimic.
