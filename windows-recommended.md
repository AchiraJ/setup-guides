## Keyboard Shortcuts

You should learn the keyboard shortcuts for tasks that you do frequently (e.g. switching between applications or tabs, opening files, etc.).

As you use the shortcuts, you'll find that many of them are shared between
applications. For instance, `Control + t` is the shortcut to open a new tab on
either Chrome or in VSCode.
