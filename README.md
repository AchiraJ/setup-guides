Local Environment Setup Guides for Kibo

## Installing and managing software

In the past, you have probably installed software either by downloading it from the internet, or by installing it from an App Store of some kind. While that typically works for consumer software, developer tools tend to update more frequently, and require more careful control over the versions of software installed. 

Do not download these software tools from the App Store or from a webpage. Instead, follow these instructions to install them using the Terminal. While it is not as familiar, it will give you more control over your programming environment, and will allow you to manage your software versions more powerfully.

Note: All of these tools are available for free. If you are prompted to pay for any of these tools, you are probably installing the wrong tool.
