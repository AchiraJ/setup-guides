## Installing and managing software

In the past, you have probably installed software either by downloading it from the internet, or by installing it from an App Store of some kind. While that typically works for consumer software, developer tools tend to update more frequently, and require more careful control over the versions of software installed. 

Do not download these software tools from the App Store or from a webpage. Instead, follow these instructions to install them using the Terminal. While it is not as familiar, it will give you more control over your programming environment, and will allow you to manage your software versions more powerfully.

Note: All of these tools are available for free. If you are prompted to pay for any of these tools, you are probably installing the wrong tool.

## Questions

**What if I already have some of this software installed?**

- If you already have Scoop, Cmder, or VSCode, you don't need to install them again. Consider updating to the latest version.
- If you already have Git or Python installed, but not through scoop, you should consider uninstalling the version you have, and reinstalling via scoop
