# Academic Software and Accounts

Watch a video walkthrough of this guide ([Windows](https://www.loom.com/share/6eee1778693e4e4bb3b8ed377ebd5755))

There is also some general-purpose software you'll use throughout your academic
program. You may already have this software installed, so skip any applications
that you already have.

For each program, use the package manager (Scoop,
Homebrew, or Apt) for your operating system to install the software.

- Zoom (`scoop install zoom` or `brew install --cask zoom`)
- Discord (`scoop install discord` or `brew install --cask discord`)
- Google Chrome Browser (`scoop install googlechrome` or `brew install --cask google-chrome`)

## Password Manager

As a technologist, you will become responsible for critical accounts and software. That means that your personal security habits, including passwords, are an important skill to develop and practice.

One primary means of protecting your online security is to use a Password Manager. We recommend _Bitwarden_ as an excellent free tool, but there are other effective tools too, especially if you are willing to pay. (Dashlane, 1Password, and LastPass are all acceptable).

* Create a Bitwarden account. Write down your master password on paper and keep it somewhere handy, but safe.
* Install Bitwarden (`scoop install bitwarden` or `brew install --cask bitwarden`)
* Install the Bitwarden browser extension
* Add passwords to your most common accounts to Bitwarden.
* As you create new accounts, including for Kibo, use Bitwarden to generate and store a strong password. Don't think of your own passwords.

If you already use a Password Manager, you can skip these steps. We **strongly encourage** that you use a Password Manager for all your passwords, instead of trying to remember them.

## Accounts

At or before Orientation, you'll be issued a new Kibo email address, with access
to the Google product suite (drive, docs, slides, sheets, forms).

You'll also need to create these accounts before you begin orientation:

- Replit
- Woolf

(We'll send you more instructions about setting up these and any other accounts).

Of course, you should use your password manager to store the logins for these accounts.

## Consistent Usernames

Over time, it's helpful to build a consistent digital identity, so that people
can recognize your profile on different platforms.

Part of your 'personal brand' has to do with your usernames and handles. Tech
culture (rightly or wrongly) uses things like github and twitter handles as a 
status marker or indicator of being in the 'in' crowd.

It's not _necessary_ to think about curating your online persona this way, but
since you are likely to keep these accounts for a long time, it might be worth
thinking about now.

**What makes a username good?**

Here's some things that can be good. There aren't real rules for this, so treat
them more as suggestions.

- use the same username across platforms (Github, Linkedin, and social media)
- use the same profile picture
- consider using your name, or part of it, if it's available
- shorter is (usually) better
- use lowercase and remove spaces

**Example: Ope**

Kibo CEO Ope uses her name as her handle across different platforms, and uses
the same profile picture. That makes her easy to identify when encountering her
on a different site, which tends to make her personal brand stronger:

- https://www.linkedin.com/in/opebukola/
- https://twitter.com/ope_bukola
- https://github.com/opebukola
- https://replit.com/@opebukola

She goes one step further and also has https://opebukola.com/. We'll talk about domains later on. 

For now, just be aware that using a consistent username across different
accounts can be a positive signal in some tech spaces.
